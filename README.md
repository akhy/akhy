### Hi there üëã

I'm a nerdy tech enthusiast living in Indonesia. 

People call me DevOps Engineer at work, and it gives the clue about my interests. I speak mostly in Go nowadays, but I'm also fluent in Python, Ruby, and shell scripting. I love to build anything useful using my skills. Drop me a message if you have any interesting work/collaboration opportunities.

I love hacking on several certain areas, but not limited to:

- Kubernetes and its ecosystem/toolings
- Infrastructure as code
- Continuous integration/delivery
- System observability
- Automation and power user tools
- Any profitable simple side hustles 
- etc

Some facts that might give you more ideas on how I work:

- I'm a CLI and keyboard guy, but don't mind using mouse
- I put my machine configs on akhy/dotfiles
- I always setup CI/CD on my projects
- I know separation of concerns and design patterns
- I love making reusable code
- I use `git fetch` + `git merge` instead of `git pull`
- I'm bad at working with datetime
- Configurable conventions pls

Cheers! üçª
