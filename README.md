### Hi there 👋

I'm a nerdy tech enthusiast living in Indonesia. 

People call me DevOps Engineer at work, and it gives the clue about my interests. I speak mostly in Go nowadays, but I'm also fluent in Python, Ruby, and shell scripting. I love to build anything useful using my skills. Drop me a message if you have any interesting work/collaboration opportunities.

I love hacking on several certain areas, but not limited to:

- Self-hosted services
- Kubernetes and its ecosystem/toolings
- Infrastructure as code
- Continuous integration/delivery
- System observability
- Automation and power user tools
- Any simple and (hopefully) profitable side hustles 
- etc

Cheers! 🍻
